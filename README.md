===========
HeartBoardX provides an inspiringly simple way to share the burden of caring for Heart Failure patients. It is easing the burden of sharing the burden, by providing a simple way to quickly spread a plan accross multiple helpers and loved ones. We are providing each loved one with the history and information regarding present care and treatment needs of the patient, without requiring researching, reading, memorizing; all they have to do is show up, scan the patient's QR code and doing the items listed, clicking each btton as they are done.
